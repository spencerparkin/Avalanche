		<h1>Avalanche Notes</h2>
		<h2>Introduction & Motivation</h2>
		<p>
			What follows are notes I'm keeping on avalanche risk management.  This information
			is based upon the books I've read and the courses I've taken.  The goal here is to
			help me get a handle on everything by condensing it down into simpler parts.
			I continually revise these notes as my understanding grows or changes.
		</p>

		<h2>Backcountry Skiing</h2>
		<p>
			The art of back-country skiing is your choice of which terrain to travel through, how to travel through it,
			and when to do so.  While spacial considerations allow us to choose our terrain, it is our timing that allows us to choose the weather and snowpack conditions we'll encounter.  Scoping a great line and
			then actually skiing it requires one to execute a plan who's success or failure is determined by Mother Nature alone.
			Skiing the line is only secondary to the goal of returning to your car.  To that end, the backcountry tourist
			must do the following...
			<ol>
				<li>Gather information for the tour as part of a pre-trip planning phase.</li>
				<li>Gather information while touring that will either confirm or refute pre-trip notions of stability.  (Always be ready/willing to change your mind.)</li>
				<li>Differentiate between signficant and insignificant data.</li>
				<li>Base every decision upon an accurate integration of all available information thus far collected.</li>
				<li>Be willing to make course corrections, ski alternatives, or even abort the whole mission.</li>
				<li>Refuse to base decisions off of too little information.  Enough uncertanty must be eliminated.  The odds are against you if you do otherwise.</li>
			</ol>
			To avoid a slide, the information gathered and analyzed must be based upon the main factors that contribute to avalanche activity.
			These are...
			<ol>
				<li>Terrain,</li>
				<li>Weather,</li>
				<li>Snowpack.</li>
			</ol>
			Avalanches are not random events.  They happen for particular reasons involving these factors at one time or another.
			It is impossible to be certain of stability, but we can manage the risk of taveling in avalanche terrain if...
			<ol>
				<li>We know how each of these factors contributes to avalanche activity,</li>
				<li>We track the history of each factor (terrain is mostly static, but snowpack and wheather are quite dynamic),</li>
				<li>We know how each of these factors interacts with the others.</li>
				<li>We can predict the future state of each factor (the weather man does his job so that we can predict the snowpack.)</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			There is also a human factor that contributes to avalanche accidents.
			Human ego, pride, laziness, and peer-pressure, are just a few examples that can get you into trouble,
			because they can affect your decision making.  Familiarty with the terrain is another problem.
			If a slope has never pulled out for you when riding it, you can sometimes develop a false sense
			of security on that slope.  If terrain is capable of facilitating an avalanche, it is not a question
			of <i>if</i>, but <i>when</i> an avalanche will occur on that terrain.
		</p>
		<h2>Terrain</h2>
		<p>
			Avalanches have a start zone, a path they follow (the track), and a deposition zone (the run-out zone.)  We must know where on the terrain
			any one of these zones may exist.  In general, they exist...
			<ol>
				<li>On any slope between 30 to 45 degrees,</li>
				<li>Adjacent or close-enough to any slope between 30 to 45 degrees,</li>
			</ol>
			The first of these is obvious, but the second is a subtlety of terrain that may be tricky to identify.  We have to remember that the snow is all connected from place to place, and the ability for disturbances in one part of the snowpack to be communicated to others depends on the state of the snowpack.  We also might try to imagine how an avalanche would flow through the terrain features we encounter.  Doing so, ridge-lines are clearly going to be generally safer than bowls, but remember that ridge-lines can also be steep.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to terrain features and steepness, the material properties of the snow must also be taken into account when considering where avalanches can happen on the terrain.  Slab fractures can propagate up-hill and even pull out flat hill-top areas.  Hills can be...
			<ol>
				<li>Convex -- A slab is stressed most at the roll-over point,</li>
				<li>Concave -- A slab may receive some compressive support, but only on a small-enough scale,</li>
				<li>Flat -- A slab could fracture anywhere; usually above you.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Beware of terrain traps.  These include, but are not limited to...
			<ol>
				<li>Gullys that are deposition zones where snow would pile deep even in a small avalanche,</li>
				<li>Cliff bands intersecting a run-out zone where even a small avalanche could throw you off the cliff.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The slope angle range of 30 to 45 degrees comes about as slopes that are too shallow don't allow the friction
			force to be overcome by gravity, while slopes that are too steep don't collect snow deep enough to slide as
			the snow continually sloughs off.  In extreme conditions, slope angles less than 30 degrees can avalanche.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aspect is a critical characteristic of terrain.  In the Northern hemisphere...
			<ol>
				<li>North/north-east facing slopes get little sun while,
				<li>South/south-west facing slopes (solar aspects) get a great deal of sun.
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Yet another consideration of where avalanches can happen on the terrain takes into account how much shade ther terrain gets, how deep the snowpack tends to be in certain places, and where boulders and trees are located.  Each of these influences the snowpack stability in terms of possible trigger spots.
			Trees can act as anchors if slabs are stiff-enough, but if an avalanche does occur despite this, it will be much more catastrophic as you're raked through the trees.
		</p>
		<h2>Weather</h2>
		<p>
			Weather is the main driving force behind changes in the snowpack.
			Weather changes the snowpack in at least the following ways...
			<ol>
				<li>Layers of the snowpack are generated with each precipitation event,</li>
				<li>Wind transports snow from one location to another (typically much faster than precipitation.)</li>
				<li>Wheather changes the thermal properties of the snow-pack which, in turn, drives metamorphism within the snowpack.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Snow</h3>
		<p>
			Snow comes in many varieties...
			<ol>
				<li>Blah...</li>
			</ol>
			Note that 5 inches of new snow is not very helpful information.  We also need to know the density of the new snow.
			(Is it wet or dry snow?)  This helps us determine the significance of the newly added load on the snowpack.
		</p>
		<h3>Wind</h3>
		<p>
			Wind can do the following...
			<ol>
				<li>Top-load slopes, cross-load ridges, (load the lee-ward side),</li>
				<li>Destroy surface hoar, preventing it from becoming a future, persistent weak layer,</li>
				<li>Produce massive cornices that, if fell, could trigger an avalanche,</li>
				<li>Create wind-drifted snow, a relatively consolidated layer that may be hollow sounding.</li>
			</ol>
			It's really important that you can learn to recognize the effects of wind while traveling in avalanche terrain.  Looking at the snow surface, you should, for example, be able to tell which
			direction the wind has been blowing, if at all.
		</p>
		<h3>Rain</h3>
		<p>
			Rain can do the following...
			<ol>
				<li>Blah...</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Sun</h3>
		<p>
			On solar aspects, the sun can...
			<ol>
				<li>Create crusts.  Once burried, they can act as bed-surfaces for slab avalanches, and promote faceting immediately above or below the crust due to the high tempature gradient they induce.</li>
				<li>Help stabilize the snow faster as the process of sintering is promoted.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Cloudy or Clear Nights</h3>
		<p>
			Clear nights can...
			Cloud insulation...
			Surface hoar can become a particular nasty and persistent weak layer within the snowpack.
		</p>
		<h3>Freeze/Thaw Cycle</h3>
		<p>
			Corn snow...
			Timing is important...
		</p>
		<h2>Snowpack</h2>
		<p>
			Influenced by terrain and produced by wheather (both of which being already complicated in and of themselves),
			the snowpack itself is an incredibly complicated beast.  This dragon lashes out (the snowpack fails) when it
			experiences more stress than it can handle in a certain period of time.  If, on the other hand, the same
			amount of stress is added in increments over a longer period of time, the snowpack can adjust.  Stress events
			include, but are not limited to...
			<ol>
				<li>Storms,</li>
				<li>Skiers,</li>
				<li>Cornice drops.</li>
			</ol>
			Time to adjust between stress events, however, does not always mean the snowpack is becoming more stable.
			During periods of stable weather, ongoing processes within the snowpack may still be driving it toward unstable conditions.
			The hardest avalanches to predict are those where, for many days, the snowpack hangs in the balance between stable and unstable,
			just waiting for the next stress event (e.g., a skier) to come along and trigger it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Persistent sources of stress on the snowpack include...
			<ol>
				<li>Roll-over points on a convex slope,</li>
				<li>Shear stress caused by one layer flowing viscously at a different rate than an adjacent layer.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Anatomy of the Snowpack</h3>
		<p>
			The snowpack is made up of layers, each of its own consistency, temporature, strength, and cohesion; each deposited by
			a storm or wind, changed by sun, or developed as frost; each of which has changed little or greatly
			since being burried.
			The interfaces between layers also vary in how well the layers are bonded.
		</p>
		<p>
			The presence of strong layers in the snowpack does not mean a strong snowpack.  We have to look at the
			relative strength between layers.  The pattern we're looking for is a layer of any strength over a relatively weak layer.
			This, along with a steep-enough slope, and a trigger, is the recipe for a potential slab avalanche.
		</p>
		<h3>Processes within the Snowpack</h3>
		<p>
			Temporature gradiants measured between layers (differences in temporature over differences in depth-based location)
			drive a process of change within the snowpack known as metamorphism.  (These gradients drive the movement of
			water vaper which, in turn, drives the metamorphism.)
			There are 3 basic kinds of metamorphism that occur within the snowpack.  These are...
			<ol>
				<li>Rounding of grains (sintering) -- the production of relatively strong/cohesive snow,</li>
				<li>Faceting of grains -- the production of relatively weak/uncohesive snow.</li>
				<li>Melt/freeze -- a cycle that alternates between the two in early Spring.</li>
			</ol>
			Without getting specific about numbers, low gradients or a lack of gradient produces rounding
			while high-enough gradients produce faceting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Air temporatures will clearly influence this process, but so does the depth of the snowpack.
			Shallow places in the snowpack are more likely to be avalanche triggers, because...
			<ol>
				<li>Shorter distances between layers means higher temporature gradients, which means more facenting,</li>
				<li>Shorter distances means that a skier's weight has influence over more layers of the snowpack,</li>
				<li>Fracture propagation is more likely to happen from shallow depths to deeper depths rather than vice-versa.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Advanced facets within the snowpack are known as sugar-snow or depth hoar, not to be confused with surface hoar--the
			equivalent of dew in the winter time.
		</p>
		<h3>Spacial Variability</h3>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, a snow profile dug and analyzed in one place tells you only exactly what is going on in
			that one place.  It may not generalize further than a radius of just a few feet.  However, if you dig
			many fast pits in many places, the combined information may be able to give you an accurate picture of
			what's going on.  Another problem with pits, however, is that where they need to be dug may not be a safe place.
			Also, digging many pits will leave you wet and cold.  Other stability tests may be more effective.
		</p>
		<p>
			The critical point to be aware of is that the properties of the snowpack very, not just with depth,
			but also across the surface and inner sub-surfaces of the snowpack.  The variances can be dramatic.
		</p>
		<h3>Material Properties of Snow</h3>
		<p>
			Snow exhibits some interesting material properties that determine how it may deform.  These are...
			<ol>
				<li>It can act viscously (when stressed slowly),</li>
				<li>It can act as a brittle substance (when stressed too quickly.)</li>
			</ol>
			The snow is constantly flowing in at least two ways due to gravity...
			<ol>
				<li>Glide -- The whole pack from top to bottom moves together parallel to the slope,</li>
				<li>Creep -- Higher layers flow down-slope faster than lower-layers.</li>
			</ol>
			These are an illustration of the viscous properties of snow.  If stressed too quickly, the snowpack
			can shatter like glass.
		</p>
		<h3>Potential Energy Stored within the Snowpack</h3>
		<p>
			For slab avalanches, we have to look at two things...
			<ol>
				<li>How likely is it that a fracture will initiate within a weak layer?</li>
				<li>How likely is it that an initiated fracture will propagate through the weak layer and across the slope?</li>
			</ol>
			The likelyhood of both is needed to produce a slab avalanche, so we need to get a feel for both
			when we're out in avalanche terrain.
			<ol>
				<li>Fracture initiation potential -- This is a measure of the strength between snow-grain bonds as they sinter or facet.  Initiation is likely in a persistent weak layer.</li>
				<li>Fracture propagation potential -- This is a measure of the persistent shear stress between layers in the snowpack as they deform, I think.  I need to read up on this again.</li>
			</ol>
			Note that fracture propagation has at least two consequences...
			<ol>
				<li>You can trigger an avalanche remotely, such as from the bottom where its deposition zone will be,</li>
				<li>The avalanche crown will crack above you, making it much less likely you can escape the avalanche once it begins.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Stress vs. Strength</h3>
		<p>
		<!--most discouraging to think that a slope tolerates 10 skiers, but it's the 11th that triggers a slide.-->
		</p>
		<!--Effectiveness of anchors.
		Bridging.
		Creep/glide = top moves more than base/whole thing moves together downward.-->
		<h2>Taking Action to Avoid Avalanches</h2>
		<p>
			Now that we're theroughly terrified of avalanches, what can we do?
			The good news is that in most avalanches that capture a person, it was that person or a member of
			their party that triggered the avalanche.  This means that our decisions can determine our fate
			in avalanche terrain.
		</p>
		<h3>Critical Observations</h3>
		<p>
			While traveling in avalanche terrain, the following kinds of observations cannot be missed if present.
			<ol>
				<li>First and foremost: avalanches.  It doesn't get clearer than this.  If you see an avalanche, or the aftermath of one that has recently slid, then all slopes on similar aspects and elevations that haven't yet slid are extremely suspect.</li>
				<li>Whumping noises indicate the snowpack is in a state that promotes fracture initiation as the noise is generated from weak-layer collapsing.</li>
				<li>Shooting cracks indicate that the snowpack is in a state that promotes fracture propagation.</li>
				<li>Hollow-drum sounds indicate the presence of wind-slabs.</li>
			</ol>
			These observations can't be missed.  However, realize that avalanches can be triggered when none of these observations can be made.
			Mother-Nature will not always give us obvious clues; we have to look for some of them.
