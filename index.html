		<h1>Avalanche Notes</h2>
		<h2>Introduction & Motivation</h2>
		<p>
			What follows are notes I'm keeping on avalanche risk management.  This information
			is based upon the books I've read and the courses I've taken.  The goal here is to
			help me get a handle on everything by condensing it down into simpler parts.
			I continually revise these notes as my understanding grows or changes.
		</p>

		<h2>Backcountry Skiing</h2>
		<p>
			The art of back-country skiing is your choice of which terrain to travel through, how to travel through it,
			and when to do so.  Our timing allows us to choose the weather and snowpack conditions.  Scoping a great line and
			then actually skiing it requires one to execute a plan who's success or failure is determined by Mother Nature alone.
			Skiing the line is only secondary to the goal of returning to your car.  To that end, the backcountry tourist
			must do the following...
			<ol>
				<li>Gather information for the tour as part of a pre-trip planning phase.</li>
				<li>Gather information while touring that will either confirm or refute pre-trip notions of stability.</li>
				<li>Differentiate between signficant and insignificant data.</li>
				<li>Base every decision upon an accurate integration of all available information thus far collected.</li>
				<li>Be willing to make course corrections, ski alternatives, or even abort the whole mission.</li>
			</ol>
			To avoid a slide, the information gathered and analyzed must be based upon the main factors that contribute to avalanche activity.
			These are...
			<ol>
				<li>Terrain,</li>
				<li>Weather,</li>
				<li>Snowpack.</li>
			</ol>
			Avalanches are not random events.  They happen for particular reasons involving these 3 main factors at one time or another.
			It is impossible to be certain of stability, but we can manage the risk of taveling in avalanche terrain if...
			<ol>
				<li>We know how each of these 3 factors contributes to avalanche activity,</li>
				<li>We track the history of each factor (terrain is mostly static, but snowpack and wheather are quite dynamic),</li>
				<li>We know how each of these 3 factors interacts with the others.</li>
				<li>We can predict the future state of each factor (the weather man does his job so that we can predict the snowpack.)</li>
			</ol>
			On the other hand, we can be absolutely certain of instability.
			If we see an avalanche, then slopes of similar aspect and elevation
			upon which the slope pulled out are clearly unsafe.
		</p>
		<h2>Terrain</h2>
		<p>
			Avalanches have a start zone, a path they follow (the run-out zone), and a deposition zone.  We must know where on the terrain
			any one of these zones may exist.  In general, they exist...
			<ol>
				<li>On any slope between 30 to 45 degrees,</li>
				<li>Adjacent or close-enough to any slope between 30 to 45 degrees,</li>
			</ol>
			The first of these is obvious, but the second is a subtlety of terrain that may be tricky to identify.  We might
			try to imagine how an avalanche would flow through the terrain we encounter.
			In this case, ridge-lines are clearly going to be generally safer than bowls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the meterial properties of the snow must also be taken into account when considering where avalanches can happen.
			Slab fractures can propagate up-hill and even pull out flat hill-top areas.  Hills can be...
			<ol>
				<li>Convex -- A slab is stressed most at the roll-over point,</li>
				<li>Concave -- A slab may receive some compressive support, but only on a small-enough scale,</li>
				<li>Flat -- A slab could fracture anywhere; usually above you.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Beware of terrain traps.  These include, but are not limited to...
			<ol>
				<li>Gullys that are deposition zones where snow would pile deep even in a small avalanche,</li>
				<li>Cliff bands intersecting a run-out zone where even a small avalanche could throw you off the cliff.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The slope angle range of 30 to 45 degrees comes about as slopes that are too shallow don't allow the friction
			force to be overcome by gravity, while slopes that are too steep don't collect snow deep enough to slide as
			the snow continually sloughs off.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aspect is a critical characteristic of terrain.  In the Northern hemisphere...
			<ol>
				<li>North/north-east facing slopes get little sun while,
				<li>South/south-west facing slopes (solar aspects) get a great deal of sun.
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h2>Weather</h2>
		<p>
			Weather is the main driving force behind changes in the snowpack.
			Weather changes the snowpack in at least the following ways...
			<ol>
				<li>Layers of the snowpack are generated with each precipitation event,</li>
				<li>Wind transports snow from one location to another (typically much faster than precipitation.)</li>
				<li>Wheather changes the thermal properties of the snow-pack which, in turn, drives metamorphism within the snowpack.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Snow</h3>
		<p>
			Snow comes in many varieties...
			<ol>
				<li>Blah...</li>
			</ol>
			Note that 5 inches of new snow is not very helpful information.  We also need to know the density of the new snow.
			(Is it wet or dry snow?)  This helps us determine the significance of the newly added load on the snowpack.
		</p>
		<h3>Wind</h3>
		<p>
			Wind can do the following...
			<ol>
				<li>Top-load slopes, cross-load ridges, (load the lee-ward side),</li>
				<li>Destroy surface hoar, preventing it from becoming a future, persistent weak layer,</li>
				<li>Produce massive cornices that, if fell, could trigger an avalanche,</li>
				<li>Create wind-drifted snow, a relatively consolidated layer that may be hollow sounding.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Rain</h3>
		<p>
			Rain can do the following...
			<ol>
				<li>Blah...</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Sun</h3>
		<p>
			On solar aspects, the sun can...
			<ol>
				<li>Create crusts.  Once burried, they can act as bed-surfaces for slab avalanches, and promote faceting immediately above or below the crust due to the high tempature gradient they induce.</li>
				<li>Help stabilize the snow faster as the process of sintering is promoted.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Cloudy or Clear Nights</h3>
		<p>
			Clear nights can...
			Cloud insulation...
			Surface hoar can become a particular nasty and persistent weak layer within the snowpack.
		</p>
		<h3>Freeze/Thaw Cycle</h3>
		<p>
			Corn snow...
			Timing is important...
		</p>
		<h2>Snowpack</h2>
		<p>
			Influenced by terrain and produced by wheather (both of which being already complicated in and of themselves),
			the snowpack itself is an incredibly complicated beast.  This dragon lashes out (the snowpack fails) when it
			experiences more stress than it can handle in a certain period of time.  If, on the other hand, the same
			amount of stress is added in increments over a longer period of time, the snowpack can adjust.  Stress events
			include, but are not limited to...
			<ol>
				<li>Storms,</li>
				<li>Skiers,</li>
				<li>Cornice drops.</li>
			</ol>
			Time to adjust between stress events, however, does not always mean the snowpack is becoming more stable.
			During periods of stable weather, ongoing processes within the snowpack may still be driving it toward unstable conditions.
			The hardest avalanches to predict are those where, for many days, the snowpack hangs in the balance between stable and unstable,
			just waiting for the next stress event (e.g., a skier) to come along and trigger it.
		</p>
		<h3>Anatomy of the Snowpack</h3>
		<p>
			The snowpack is made up of layers, each of its own consistency, temporature, strength, and cohesion; each deposited by
			a storm or wind, changed by sun, or developed as frost; each of which has changed little or greatly
			since being burried.
			The interfaces between layers also vary in how well the layers are bonded.
		</p>
		<p>
			The presence of strong layers in the snowpack does not mean a strong snowpack.  We have to look at the
			relative strength between layers.  The pattern we're looking for is a layer of any strength over a relatively weak layer.
			This is the recipe for a potential slab avalanche.
		</p>
		<h3>Processes within the Snowpack</h3>
		<p>
			Temporature gradiants measured between layers (differences in temporature over differences in distance)
			drive a process of change within the snowpack known as metamorphism.
			There are 2 basic kinds of metamorphism that occur within the snowpack.  These are...
			<ol>
				<li>Rounding of grains (sintering) -- the production of relatively strong/cohesive snow,</li>
				<li>Faceting of grains -- the production of relatively weak/uncohesive snow.</li>
			</ol>
			Without getting specific about numbers, low gradients produce rounding while high gradients produce faceting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Air temporatures will clearly influence this process, but so does the depth of the snowpack.
			Shallow places in the snowpack will therefore experience greater temporature gradients, and therefore are
			prone to greater development of weak laters, and become trigger spots.
		</p>
		<p>
			Advanced facets within the snowpack are known as sugarsnow or depth hoar, not to be confused with surface hoar--the
			equivilant of dew in the winter time.
		</p>
		<h3>Potential Energy Stored within the Snowpack</h3>
		<p>
			Initiation...
			Propagation...
		</p>
		<h3>Spacial Variability</h3>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, a snow profile dug and analyzed in one place tells you only exactly what is going on in
			that one place.  It may not generalize further than a radius of just a few feet.  However, if you dig
			many fast pits in many places, the combined information may be able to give you an accurate picture of
			what's going on.  Another problem with pits, however, is that where they need to be dug may not be a safe place.
			Also, digging many pits will leave you wet and cold.  Other stability tests may be more effective.
		</p>
		<h3>Material Properties of Snow</h3>
		<p>
			Snow exhibits some interesting material properties.  These are...
			<ol>
				<li>It acts like puddy.</li>
				<li>It acts like...</li>
			</ol>

		Bridging.
		Creep/glide = top moves more than base/whole thing moves together downward.-->
